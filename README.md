# texecom-python
Python Utilities for monitoring Texecom alarm systems

This script analyses the log files generated by Texecom's Texbase software. This was chosen as Texecom use a propriatary protocol for communication between their alarm and alarm monitoring system.

Alarm data flows from the COM-IP module installed on the alarm to the Montex Alarm Receiver software via a propriatary TCP/IP protocol. The Montex software then sends the information to the Texbase Alarm Monitor software via a seccond propriatary TCP/IP protocol.
Access to the propriatary protocols requires a reseller to agree to an NDA, which was not suitable for my project. The logs generated by the Texbase software were chosen as the easiest place to retrieve the data.

This script analyses the log files generated by the software, and provides an example output of the data in a readable format to STDOUT.

# Setting up the software

1. Purchase and configure a COM-IP module. This gives your Texecom alarm a network port and IP address. Although the COM-IP module is able to run custom software, access to set this up is also restricted to being a reseller with an NDA.
Once the COM-IP module is set up, it is easier to use the Wintex software to do further configuration on the alarm.
The COM-IP module can be configured in Wintex be navigating to the Comms page and switching to the Radio-Pad and Com Port Options tab. Here, the following settings can be configured:

![Settings Window](../master/Screenshots/2016-01-18 11_46_17-Wintex UDL - [Communication Options].png)

1. IP Address of the COM-IP unit
2. TCP Port for propriatary communications to the COM-IP unit
3. Gateway of the COM-IP unit
4. Subnet mask of the COM-IP Unit
5. IP Address of the server/VM running the Montex software
6. TCP Port of the Montex software

Once this is configured, the COM-IP module will attempt to send data to the Montex software.
The Montex software has the following configuration:

![Settings Window](../master/Screenshots/2016-01-18 11_53_19-Coms Setup.png)

1. IP and Port that the Montex software listens on. The IP address cannot be modified, and must be changed in the OS. The port should be set the same as 6 in the Wintex software
2. The connection method used to send data to the Texbase software, this should be set to TCP/IP
3. The IP and port uses to send data to the Texbase software
4. The protocol used to send data to the Texbase software, this should be set to Basic
5. Various protocol settings used when sending data to the Texbas softawre. These should be set as per the screenshot

So far, we have set up Alarm -> Montex. Now we need to set up Montex -> Texbase, which has useful log files.
The only configuration in the Texbase software is the TCP port, which should be set to the same as the port in option 3 in the Montex software.

At this point, we have data flowing from the Alarm into Montex, then from Montex into Texbase, then from Texbase into the log files.
The texecom-logs.py script can then be used to analyse this log files. The script provides an example output to STDOUT
